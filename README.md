# 012-employee-database

## Description

The goal of the challenge was to create a command line application that is an employee database using node.js, inquirer, and MySQL2. The application should allow users to view and add employees, roles, and departments, as well as update employee roles. This is achieved by using the inquirer package to prompt the user for input and the MySQL2 package to connect to a MySQL database.
